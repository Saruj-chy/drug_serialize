# drug_serialize

This is a research project create on flutter. The purpose of this research work is to focus on drug serialization that helps in the verification and identification of counterfeit medicines by allowing patients and healthcare professionals to check the authenticity of a drug before its intended use.
Fake drugs do not cure patients, but carry many other dangerous side effects.According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality
Therefore, the pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh need to find a system that tracks drug supply at every stage to solve that adulteration problem. I propose a technology that is already implemented in many developed countries in the world to solve the problem. That is serialization. Pharmaceutical serialization is not new compliance, and it was initially introduced by Turkey in 2010, and other market such as the China and South Korea [2]. The serialization technology is a very effective technology in the fight against counterfeit drugs. It is a new secure technology that implements advanced tamper proof packaging methods to detect drug safety and also successful in reducing counterfeit drugs through the supply chain. Pharmaceutical serialization involves assigning unique serial number to each salable product pack. In this case each product pack contains product origin, Global Trade Information and Identification Number (GTIN), batch number, expiry date and unique serial number. Which helps to identify the product.
